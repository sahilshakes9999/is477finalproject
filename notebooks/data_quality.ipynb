# Data Quality Notebook

This notebook shows basic profiling and quality checks on the merged dataset
`music_culture_merged.csv`. These checks support the *Data Quality Assessment*
section of the README.

import pandas as pd

merged_path = "data/processed/music_culture_merged.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(merged_path)
df.head()

## Missing values per column
df.isna().sum()

df.describe(include="all")

We observe:

- Some countries may have missing GDP or internet usage values (dropped in cleaning).
- Numeric columns such as `gdp_per_capita` and `internet_users_pct` fall within
  reasonable ranges.
- No duplicate `country_name` rows appear in the merged dataset.

These observations are summarized in the README under *Data Quality Assessment*.
