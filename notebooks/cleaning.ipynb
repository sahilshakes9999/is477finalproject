## cleaning notebook

This notebook documents the basic cleaning steps applied to the raw Spotify
and World Bank data. The same logic is implemented in the Python scripts
`clean_spotify.py` and `clean_worldbank.py`, but this notebook provides an
interactive, documented view of what those scripts do.
