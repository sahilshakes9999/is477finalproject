# Integration Notebook

This notebook illustrates how the cleaned Spotify and World Bank datasets
are integrated into a single country-level dataset. The logic here mirrors
the `integrate.py` script.

import pandas as pd

sp = pd.read_csv("data/processed/spotify_clean.csv")
wb = pd.read_csv("data/processed/worldbank_clean.csv")

sp.head()

# Aggregate Spotify to country-level
agg_sp = sp.groupby("country_name").agg(
    avg_popularity=("popularity", "mean"),
    avg_bpm=("bpm", "mean"),
    track_count=("track_name", "nunique"),
).reset_index()

agg_sp.head()

merged = pd.merge(agg_sp, wb, on="country_name", how="inner")
merged.head()

The resulting dataframe matches the structure of
`data/processed/music_culture_merged.csv` produced by `integrate.py`.
Only countries present in both datasets are retained (inner join).
