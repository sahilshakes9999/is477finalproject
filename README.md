Music streaming platforms such as Spotify have transformed how people access and engage with music across the globe. As listening behavior becomes increasingly digitized, streaming metrics offer a unique lens into cultural preferences and global media consumption patterns. At the same time, country-level socioeconomic factors—such as income, connectivity, and population size—continue to shape how cultural products spread and which genres gain traction across regions.

This project investigates how Spotify track popularity varies across countries in relation to socioeconomic indicators from the World Bank. By integrating two distinct datasets—(1) Spotify Top 50 by Country from Kaggle, and (2) the World Bank Indicators API (GDP per capita, internet users, and population)—the study explores whether countries with different economic conditions exhibit differing patterns in music popularity. This approach aligns with core IS 477 concepts including data acquisition, cleaning, integration, workflow automation, and reproducibility.

The Spotify dataset provides country-level lists of top tracks including metadata such as artists, genres, BPM, and popularity scores. These metrics represent cultural taste signals within each country. The World Bank dataset complements this by providing quantitative socioeconomic context. Together, these sources enable a cross-disciplinary analysis bridging digital culture and macroeconomic conditions.

An end-to-end reproducible workflow was developed that programmatically acquires World Bank data, cleans and standardizes both datasets, aggregates Spotify track popularity by country, and integrates the information into a unified dataset. The project includes data profiling, quality assessment, exploratory analyses, and visualizations capturing relationships between music popularity and socioeconomic indicators.

Preliminary findings indicate a positive correlation between GDP per capita and average Spotify popularity scores, suggesting that higher-income countries may gravitate toward more globally dominant mainstream music. Similarly, countries with higher internet penetration rates tend to exhibit greater popularity levels, reinforcing the idea that digital infrastructure directly shapes cultural accessibility. The results also highlight notable regional contrasts in genre representation, BPM trends, and the concentration of top tracks across countries.

This project demonstrates how openly available datasets can be combined to generate meaningful insights at the intersection of culture and economics. Through structured documentation, metadata, workflow automation, and FAIR principles, the project ensures transparency and reproducibility for future extensions such as genre clustering, cultural distance metrics, or time-series analysis of global listening behavior.
